## About

This project was done following the instructions and lessons from the original Modern React Redux Course on Udemy. The actual project from the teacher was a book listing site, but I changed it to foods and added some small modifications to the random image added on the page. Please do be aware that some images do not actually match the name of the dish given.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project working:

### Prerequisites

npm or yarn, whichever you are more used to. The project was built with npm, but yarn should work just as fine.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation


1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:CarolZNS/food-listing.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the project server and then run the application
   ```sh
   npm run server
   npm run start
   ```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
Type in a dish or food name in the input at the bottom and make a list of all your favorite food. You can edit the name or delete the food entry. The image will be generated randomly for each entry.

The entries will be stored in the JSON server in the file db.json.
